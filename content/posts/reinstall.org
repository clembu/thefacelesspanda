* It's a new year

  So there's a tradition in my brain:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Whenever you can, rethink your workflow
  #+END_QUOTE

  Until I truly feel comfortable, I will try to find ways
  to feel more comfortable working and using things.
  Namely, here, my computer.

  I tend to do that at the end of the summer.

  I didn't think I'd do it, but I ended up actually installing
  a new Linux Distribution.

* The end of the Canonical Tyranny!
  Well, "tyranny". I don't hate Canonical, nor Ubuntu.
  But I had worked under Ubuntu for years until now,
  and I wasn't familiar with any other system.

  I decided to go and switch to the other most popular
  Distribution: [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch]]. Now, I now that Arch is pretty bare-bones,
  and I was still scared of going full-tty and
  install everything myself. I'm still not well enough versed
  in the art of handling hardware drivers.

  So I looked for Arch-based distributions, and after considering
  [[https://antergos.com/][Antergos]], I ended up going for [[https://manjaro.org/][Manjaro]], because of its
  auto-hardware-driver installer.

  I half-regret this today, because Manjaro comes with a bunch of defaults
  that I really don't like.
  Namely, it has a terrible [[https://gitlab.manjaro.org/profiles-and-settings/manjaro-browser-settings][branding override for browsers]].
  I had to work /against/ it to be able to get my Firefox New Tab as a home page,
  and get rid of their [[https://manjaro.org/][useless featureless homepage]].
  It doesn't even have a search engine.

  The one default that is great, though, is the desktop theme.
  I'll get back to that after I talk about the desktop itself, though.
  Which is now.

* I, I, I.
  Ever since my Windows age, I have been conditioned to use windows.
  It's all I've known. Those floating frames you can move around and resize with your mouse.
  But as soon as I started trying to be productive and do stuff with my computers,
  I ended up maxmizing those frames, and sometimes putting them side to side and
  clamping them to the edge of the screen.

  Little did I know, floating frames are not the only way you can manage your desktop!
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager][Tiling windows managers]] have been around since the eighties, even!
  How did I not know that??

  So, remember when I said [[/posts/kitty-setup/#the-problem][Kitty's internal windows solved a huge problem for me]]?
  Well now, [[https://i3wm.org/][i3wm]] does it!

  I don't need Kitty's tiling capacities, as my whole desktop experience is about
  tiling space into chunks of content. The bonus cool thing about i3 is how easy it is
  to configure it! I remember growing headaches trying to understand
  how system keyboard shortcuts worked under gnome and how to edit them
  outside of the =gnome-settings= app.
  
  Well no more!
  I edit =~/.config/i3/config= and boom!
  
  And it's not even complicated!
  here's how it looks like to bind my nifty Kitty to =Alt+Enter=
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  bindsym Mod1+Return exec kitty
  #+END_SRC

  How simple is that, really?

* Onigiri üçô 
  Now's the moment when I talk about the core of the matter of this post and the ones to come:
  Rice.

  No, not üçö, nor üçô, or even üçõ.

  Rice is a term that I learned recently that apparently means something different to nerds
  that it does to the rest of the world.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Rice.
    Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements
  #+END_QUOTE

  The term comes from automobile prettifying.
  That's what we'll be doing, but not with cars, with desktops and workflows.

  I'll be going through all the steps I'm passing through as I rice my system up,
  and maybe help you learn a thing or two.

  It will be different than the previous post about Kitty, that had nothing really useful.
  This time I will dive into the details of what I'm doing and give some visual results.
  I mean my post about /Kitty being cute/ had no pictures in it. Sad stuff.

  I'll try to step up my figure game when I get back to online-land.
  If you haven't seen pictures yet, you get a free /Slap The Panda/ coupon.

  Anyway, let's rice this thing up!
  We'll be looking at i3 config, conky scripts, rofi plugins, theming, all sorts of stuff!
  Maybe even keyboard layout creation!

  In order for things to be kind of organized, I'll do things one blog post at a time.

  This is all for today. This post is already long enough.
  Next time we'll be looking at Manjaro-i3's default config and sort out what to change.
